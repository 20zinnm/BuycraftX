# BuycraftX

BuycraftX is an entirely new plugin for use with the [Buycraft.net service](https://www.buycraft.net).

## The major differences

* A total rewrite of the plugin based on modern coding standards. The new plugin is geared towards reliability and performance.
* Only compatible with Spigot 1.8 or greater currently, however the plugin will support multiple platforms.
* Custom item IDs are not supported, as it is not portable to other platforms and is deprecated.
